# Movies-Near-You
A web-app to display list of real-time movies in theaters, their trailers, IMDB rating.

# Description:  
In this application I have developed an application with a basic GUI where the user can find the latest movies, read their reviews and also can book tickets using Fandango.  

I make use of three open source APIs:  
▪ OMDB API  
▪ TMDB API  
▪ Fandango API  


# About:
▪ Consumed RESTful API’s to include feature to book tickets in theatres based on user’s location.  
▪ Used JavaScript to query and parse real-time JSON data and to create a GUI.
